# Pronunciation

## Vowels
```
a   =   as the "a" in "father"
e   =   as the "e" in "get"
i   =   as the "i" in "pin"
o   =   as the "o" in "lot"
u   =   as the "u" in "put", not the "yu" sound in "use"
```

### Long Vowels
- Represented by double notations or macrons
- Vowel pronounced twice as long as short vowel
- Affects meaning of word

### Reduced Vowels
- Vowel `u` is often not pronounced
  - `gakusei`, sounds like `gaksei`
  - `-desu` and `-masu`, sounds like `des` and `mas`

## Consonants
- Most sounds similar to English
- Except:
```
r  = single flap of the toungue againist ridge behind front teeth.  Cross between "r" and "l"
f  = release vowel "u" while the lips are held as if you were about to whistle.  Pronouns "f" like English "f"
g  = always hard as in "good", never soft as in "general"
ts = as the "ts" ub "cats" even at the start of a word
```

### Double Consonants
- Slight pause between double consonants, e.g. `gakko`, "school", is pronounced `ga` (pause) `ko`

### Apostrophes
- Pause slightly between an apostrophe and following syllables.  Only found after `n` and gives different pronunciation and meaning
```
kinen   =  commemoration
kin'en  =  non-smoking
```

## Reading Japanese
- Usually written vertically and for right to left
- Occasionally written horizontally like English
- Combination of three different scripts:
  - Kanji (ideographic characters)
  - Hiragana and katakanJapanese
- Borrowed from Chinese represent both meaning and pronunciation
- Up to 20 strokes
- Pronounced differently depending on context
  - `水` by itself is pronounced as `mizu`
  - `水分` is pronounced as `sui`
- Large number of kanji common between Japan and China
- Over 2000 in use everyday in Japan

### Hiragana
- Represent particles and grammatical endings particular Japanese
- Placed along side kanji
- A single Japanese word may contain both kanji and hiragana
```
(I) drank water     mizu o nomimashita
                    水お飲みました。
```
In this sentence, particle `o / お` and the verb ending `mashita / ました`, are all in hiragana

### Katakana
- Used to indicate many recent borrowings from other languages
- Used extensively in Japan
- Useful for writing your name
```
I'm John. I'm Canadian.     jon desu. kanadajin desu.
                            ジョンです。 カナダ人です。
```
Here, the word `John / ジョン` and `Canada / カナダ` in katakana
