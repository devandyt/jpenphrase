# Grammar
- Know how to string simple sentences together
- Show different levels of formality by choosing particular words and often changing forms of verbs
- This guide use standard polite `-masu` forms that is suitable for most situations

## Word Order
- English order _subject-verb-object_
  - `i bought this book`
- Japanese order _subject-object-verb_
  - `i this book bought`
- Japanese often omit subject if it is obvious or unimportant
  - `this book bought`
```
I bought this book.  =   (watashi ga) kono hon o kaimashita
                         (lit: I-ga this book-o bought)
```

## Articles
- In Japanese, there is no `a` and `the`
```
This is a/the book.  =  kore wa hon desu
                        (lit: this-wa book is)
```

- Point out a specific item, use `sono`(that)
```
that book   =   sono hon
                (lit: that book)
```

## Particles
- A Japanese noun or pronoun is almost always followed by a particle
- Each particle has at least one function related to the preceding noun or pronoun
- Particles show us whether preceding word is the
  - subject (who or what is doing something)
  - or object (the person or thing that is having something done to it)
- Other times, they are equivalent to English prepositions such as `in` or `to`
- Example:
  - `ga`, `wa`, `o`, `no`, `ni`, and `e`

### Subject Particle
- The particle `ga` marks the subject:
```
This person is Mr Suzuki.   =   kono hito ga Suzuki-san desu
                                (lit: this person-ga Suzuki-Mr is)
Petrol is expensive.        =   gasorin ga takai desu
                                (lit: petrol-ga expensive is)
```
Here, `ga` indicates that the preceding nouns `knon hito` (this person) and `gasorin` (petrol) are the subject

### Topic Particle
- The particle `wa` marks the topic or the focal point of the sentence.
- `wa` is often used when clarifying or stressing a particular point.
```
This person is Mr Suzuki.   =   kono hita wa Suzuki-san desu
                                (lit: this person-wa Suzuki-Mr is)
Gasoline is expensive.      =   gasorin wa takai desu
                                (lit: petrol-wa expensive is)
```

### Object Particle
The particle `o` marks the object.
```
I ate a hamburger.  =   watashi wa hambaagaa o tabemashita
                        (lit: I-wa hamburger-o ate)
Sue saw a movie.    =   sue-san wa eiga o mimashita
